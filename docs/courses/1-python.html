The <code>f</code> before the string denotes an f-string, and any expression inside curly brackets <code>{}</code> is evaluated and interpolated into the string at runtime. This feature is useful for creating dynamic strings with embedded variable values. - Most Python developers solve this problem by defining <i>all</i> the functions in their program first, then they call an "entry point" function <i>last</i>. That way <i>all</i> of the functions have been read by the Python interpreter before the first one is called. 	- Conventionally this "entry point" function is usually called <code>main</code> to keep things simple and consistent.</p><p><code>python def main():     health = 10     armor = 5     addArmor(health, armor) def addArmor(h, a):     newHealth = h + a     printHealth(newHealth) def printHealth(newHealth):     print(f"The player now has {newHealth} health") # call entrypoint last main() </code> - Parameters are the names used for inputs when <i>defining</i> a function. Arguments are the values of the inputs supplied when a function is <i>called</i>. - Python is one of the few languages that got a built in exponents it's in the format of  - it also got built in flooring in the following formula <code>55 // 4</code>  - the flooring means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. - The built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float()</a> function can create a numeric floating point value of negative/positive infinity. - <code>negativeInfinity = float("-inf")</code> - <code>positiveInfinity = float("inf")</code> - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-tuple">Tuples</a> are collections of data that are ordered and unchangeable. You can think of a tuple as a <code>List</code> with a fixed size. Tuples are created with round brackets. - You can easily assign the values of a tuple to variables using unpacking. - <code>dogName, dogAge = dog</code>  - When you return multiple values from a function, you're actually returning a tuple. - In Python, you can check if an item exists in a list using the <code>in</code> keyword. This operation is called a membership test and returns <code>True</code> if the specified item is found in the list, and <code>False</code> otherwise. This is a simple and efficient way to verify the presence of an element within a list. <code>python heroes = ["Spiderman", "Ironman", "Thor"] print("Thor" in heroes)    # True print("Batman" in heroes)  # False </code> - <code>[]</code> -> <b>lists</b>  - indexed (ordered) - changeable  - can hold one type - <code>()</code> -> <b>tuples</b> - indexed (ordered) - unchangeable - can hold more than one type  - <code>(2,)</code> \# note the comma! It's required for a single-element tuple - <code>{}</code> -> <b>dictionaries and sets</b>  - to make and empty dict. <code>{}</code> , to make an empty set <code>set()</code> - both of them allow no duplicates - <code>set()</code> removes duplicates automatically</p><p>---</p><h3>Copying a List</h3><p>To get a <i>new copy</i> of a list, use the <code>copy()</code> method. If you just do <code>newList = oldList</code>, your new variable will just be a [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference<i>\(computer</i>science\)) to the original list... which is not what we want. <code>python nums = [4, 3, 2, 1] numsCopy = nums.copy() # numsCopy is [4, 3, 2, 1] </code></p><p>---</p></div></article>
